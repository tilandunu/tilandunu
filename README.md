## 🚀 About Me

I’m passionate about using both code and creativity to make a difference. As a developer, I specialize in the MERN stack and love crafting visually appealing, responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS. Open source is where I thrive—whether I’m contributing to existing projects or starting something new, I believe software is better when we build it together.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me creating digital art—because creativity fuels innovation, from pixels to pull requests!
